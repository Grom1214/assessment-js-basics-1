// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// 1. planning
// 2. analysis of requirements
// 3. design 
// 4. implementaion
// 5. testing & intergration
// 6. maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
let planning = "this is the stage where you think up what u want to do and how"
let analysisOfRequirements = "this is the stage where you have to create peramitors and how to acomplish the task and what u need for it"
let design = "this is the actual creation process"
let implementaion = "this is the portion where you start to apply the code to the objective"
let testingAndIntergration = "once youve tested and worked out he kinks this is where you start to use the code where it is intended for"
let maintain = "watching for any buggs nnow that it has been inergrated and fix issues with the code as it arrives"
